Earlier, I said that the |, *, and + forms we added to our grammar metasyntax were just syntactic sugar. Take this grammar:

expr → expr ( "(" ( expr ( "," expr )* )? ")" | "." IDENTIFIER )+
     | IDENTIFIER
     | NUMBER

Produce a grammar that matches the same language but does not use any of that notational sugar.

expr -> IDENTIFIER
expr -> NUMBER
expr -> expr postfixSeq

postfixSeq -> postfix postfixSeq
postfixSeq -> postfix

postfix -> "(" argList ")"
postfix -> "." IDENTIFIER

argList -> e
argList -> args

args -> expr "," args
args -> expr
